<p>If you're on this page, I guess you're interested in who I am and what I do!</p>
<p>I’m a junior, studying <b>Computer Science</b> at UC San Diego, graduating this Spring (2016). I was part of a startup team at the Moxie Center startup incubator on campus, working on stuff in the education space.
<p>I also run the cybersecurity resource <a href="securaid.com">SecurAid.com</a>.</p>
<p>This last summer, I interned at <a href="https://urx.com">URX</a>, a YC alum working on some amazing things in the deep linking space.</p>
<p>I'm excited to start working after I graduate at LendUp, a socially aware company using microcredit to help those underserved by the current banking industry.</p>
<p>I started a Photography club at UCSD, trying to create a community of photography enthusiasts here. Check out my <a href="https://500px.com/gdatta">portfolio</a>!.</p>
