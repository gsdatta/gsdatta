<p>If you're on this page, I guess you're interested in who I am and what I do!</p>
<p>I’m a junior, studying <b>Computer Science</b> at UC San Diego, graduating this Spring. I was part of a startup team at the Moxie Center startup incubator on campus, working on stuff in the education space.
<p>I also run the cybersecurity resource <a href="securaid.com">SecurAid.com</a>.</p>
<p>This last summer, I interned at <a href="https://urx.com">URX</a>, a YC alum working on some amazing things in the deep linking space.<p>
<p>I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities in backend development, distributed systems, or related fields. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsdatta">LinkedIn</a> and shoot me an email if you think I'd be a good fit!</p>
<p>To get in touch, shoot me an email at <i>me</i>@<b>[this super cool domain you’re on right now]</b>!</p>
